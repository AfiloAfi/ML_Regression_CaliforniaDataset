\**Exercise 2 – Machine Learning (Regression Task)*

---

### 📌 Project Description

This project applies **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** to predict the **median house prices** in California using the **California Housing Dataset**, which was collected during the 1990 U.S. Census.

The dataset includes various **socio-economic and demographic features**, such as:

* Median income
* Average house age
* Average number of rooms
* Population per block
* Latitude and longitude
* Housing and household statistics

The goal is to build a **predictive model** using SVM to estimate house prices based on these features.

---

### 🎯 Objectives

* Load and explore the California Housing Dataset
* Apply data preprocessing techniques (handling missing values, scaling, etc.)
* Train a Support Vector Regression model
* Evaluate performance using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score
* Visualize prediction results vs. actual values

---

### ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas**, **NumPy** – data manipulation
* **Scikit-learn** – model training and evaluation
* **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** – interactive experimentation

---

### 📊 Expected Results

* A regression model capable of accurately predicting median house prices
* Graphs showing predicted vs actual prices
* Insights into the most influential features affecting housing prices in California
